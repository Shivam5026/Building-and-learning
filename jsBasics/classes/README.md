# JavaScript Basics Challenge

Welcome to my JavaScript basics challenge! ðŸš€ In this journey, we explore fundamental concepts with practical code snippets. Let's dive in!

## Question 1: Class - Person

#### Solving Approach with Metaphor

Imagine a class as a blueprint for creating individuals. In our case, the `Person` class is like a template that defines what each person should have: a name and an age. The `greet` method is like a natural ability of a person to greet others. Creating an instance of this class is akin to bringing a new person to life.

## Question 2: Class - Car

#### Solving Approach with Metaphor

Think of a class as a factory that produces cars. The `Car` class is like the blueprint for a specific model. The properties `make`, `model`, and `year` are the unique characteristics of each car. The `displayInfo` method is similar to a car showcasing its features, telling the world about itself. Creating an instance of this class is like manufacturing a brand new car.

## Question 3: Class - Calculator

#### Solving Approach with Metaphor

Consider a class as a smart assistant for mathematical operations. The `Calculator` class is like your personal math wizard. The properties `num1` and `num2` are the numbers you provide for calculation. The methods (`add`, `sub`, etc.) are the magical spells it can perform. Creating an instance of this class is like summoning your math assistant ready to solve problems at your command.

## Question 4: Class - Student

#### Solving Approach with Metaphor

Visualize a class as a learning environment, and the `Student` class as a representation of an individual student. The properties `name` and `grades` are like the student's identity and academic record. The `addGrade` method is akin to the student receiving a new grade, and the `getAverage` method is like calculating the overall performance. Creating an instance of this class is like welcoming a new student to the school.

## Question 5: Class - Book

#### Solving Approach with Metaphor

Think of a class as a library and the `Book` class as a specific book genre. The properties `title`, `author`, and `year` are like the essential details of a book. The `getBookInfo` method is like reading the blurb on the back cover, providing a snapshot of the book. Creating an instance of this class is like adding a new book to the library shelf.
